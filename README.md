Hi there!

My name is Justin and I'm located in Edmonton, Alberta. I'm a data analyst working to improve and document my skills in data analysis.
You can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinreinke/. I'd love to hear from you with feedback and opportunities.

The goal of this project is to analyze the variables that influence the concentration of mercury (Hg) in fish found in the many waterbodies of Alberta. These data are made available by the Government of Alberta, which you can find here: https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/chemical-monitoring-in-local-foods-mercury-in-fish.

I performed this analysis using various python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file and Jupyter Notebooks. If you wish to explore the data yourself, add to or modify my analysis, etc., you can find the relevant Excel files in the `data` folder and the `.ipynb` file in the main root of this repository.

I trust you will find this analysis intriguing and I encourage you to investigate the data for yourself.

All the best,

Justin
